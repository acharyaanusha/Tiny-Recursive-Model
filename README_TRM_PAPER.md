# Tiny Recursive Model (TRM) for Reinforcement Learning

## Paper Implementation

Based on Samsung SAIL Montreal's research: [Tiny Recursive Models](https://github.com/SamsungSAILMontreal/TinyRecursiveModels)

---

## 📚 Overview

This implementation adapts the **Tiny Recursive Model (TRM)** from the paper to reinforcement learning tasks. TRM uses hierarchical recursive reasoning to progressively refine its decisions through multiple cycles of computation.

### Key Insight from the Paper

> "The idea that one must rely on massive foundational models... is a trap."

TRM achieves strong performance on complex reasoning tasks with only **7M parameters** by using recursive refinement instead of scale.

### Components

#### 1. **H-Level (Higher Reasoning)**
- Global state understanding
- Uses SwiGLU activation
- Residual connections
- Dimension: `h_dim` (default: 64)

#### 2. **L-Level (Lower Processing)**
- Local feature processing
- MLP-based transformation
- Dimension: `l_dim` (default: 32)

#### 3. **Recursive Cycles (K)**
- Default: K=3 cycles
- Each cycle: H → L → H feedback
- Carry mechanism between cycles
- Final cycle output used for action

#### 4. **Action Conditioning (Optional)**
- Previous action embedded
- Concatenated with current state
- Enables temporal reasoning

## 🚀 Usage

### Basic Training

```python
from trm_rl_paper_implementation import TRMPolicy, ImprovedMazeEnv, train_rl_with_deep_supervision

# Setup environment
env = ImprovedMazeEnv(size=5)

# Create TRM policy
policy = TRMPolicy(
    state_dim=25,
    action_dim=4,
    h_dim=64,
    l_dim=32,
    k_cycles=3
)

# Train
rewards, lengths = train_rl_with_deep_supervision(
    env,
    policy,
    n_episodes=500,
    lr=2e-3,
    entropy_coef=0.01,
    use_deep_supervision=True
)
```

### Running the Full Comparison

```bash
cd "Tiny Recursive Model (TRM)"
python trm_rl_paper_implementation.py
```

This will train:
1. TRM with K=3 cycles
2. TRM with K=5 cycles
3. MLP baseline

And generate comparison plots.

## 💡 Key Hyperparameters

### TRM Architecture
```python
h_dim = 64           # H-level dimension (increase for complex tasks)
l_dim = 32           # L-level dimension
k_cycles = 3         # Number of recursive cycles (paper uses 3-5)
n_h_layers = 2       # H-level processing depth
n_l_layers = 1       # L-level processing depth
```

### Training
```python
n_episodes = 500     # Training episodes
lr = 2e-3            # Learning rate (lower for TRM)
gamma = 0.95         # Discount factor
entropy_coef = 0.01  # Exploration bonus
```

## 🎯 When to Use TRM

### ✅ Good For:
- **Complex reasoning tasks** (puzzles, planning)
- **Iterative refinement** problems
- **Parameter efficiency** requirements
- **Multi-step reasoning**

### ❌ Not Ideal For:
- **Simple reactive tasks** (use MLP)
- **Real-time constraints** (slower due to K cycles)
- **Very high-dimensional state** (consider CNN first)

## 🔧 Customization

### Increase Recursive Depth

policy = TRMPolicy(..., k_cycles=5)  # More refinement
```

### Larger Capacity
```python
policy = TRMPolicy(..., h_dim=128, l_dim=64)  # Bigger model
```

### Deeper Processing
```python
policy = TRMPolicy(..., n_h_layers=3, n_l_layers=2)
```

### Disable Action Conditioning

policy = TRMPolicy(..., use_action_conditioning=False)
```

## 📈 Debugging Tips

### 1. **Low Rewards (-10 to -5)**
- **Issue:** Agent not learning
- **Fix:**
  - Increase learning rate to 3e-3 or 5e-3
  - Add more entropy (entropy_coef=0.02)
  - Check environment rewards

### 2. **Slow Training**
- **Issue:** K cycles take time
- **Fix:**
  - Reduce k_cycles to 2
  - Reduce n_h_layers to 1
  - Use smaller dimensions

### 3. **Unstable Learning**
- **Issue:** Rewards oscillating wildly
- **Fix:**
  - Lower learning rate to 1e-3
  - Increase gradient clipping
  - Normalize states

## 🧪 Advanced Features

### Deep Supervision
Following the paper, train on intermediate cycles:

```python
# Get logits from all K cycles
logits_all = policy(state, prev_action, return_all_cycles=True)

# Supervise each cycle (weighted by recency)
for i, logits in enumerate(logits_all):
    weight = 1.0 + 0.1 * i
    loss_i = compute_loss(logits, target)
    total_loss += weight * loss_i
```
